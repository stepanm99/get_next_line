# get_next_line
Project from 42 core curriculum. The goal of this project is to make a function that will read a file line by line. That itself would be easy but here we have fixed size of buffer into which we read data from the file. First I didn't like the limitation of buffer size but after little bit of research it starts to make sense. Because read() uses system calls to ask kernel for data. This can be lengthy process if we would ask just for one byte at a time, which could be implemented easily. With reasonably sized buffer we can minimize the need for reading thus improving performance.
